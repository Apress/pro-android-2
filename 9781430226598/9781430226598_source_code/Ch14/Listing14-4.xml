interacts with activities. This application has 4 activities
including this one. The activity you are looking at is
called a Regular Activity and is one of 4. The other three
you can access through the menu.

any search capabilities. If you click search key now

This is a very simple activity that has indicated through
the manifest file that there is a an associated search
activity. With this association when the search key is
pressed the local search is presented instead of global.

You can see the local nature of it by looking at the
label of the QSB and also the hint in the QSB. Both
came from the search metadata.
\n\n
Once you click on the query icon, it will transfer
you to the local search activity.
